##	Factors and levels
### If you're not careful you can just rename the levels of a factor rather than reordering them

I did:
```
levels(df$factor) <- levels(df$factor)[c(5,4,1,3,2)]
```
or similar and then continued merrily on with my analysis. You can even check to see that your "reordering" has worked!:
```
levels(df$factor)
```
Everything looks fine and the levels are in the right order! Except... you haven't actually reordered the levels. It just looks like you have. You have actually just re-allocated the names of the levels. And your survey data that was originally tagged "Very unhappy" might now be tagged "Very happy"...

### How to do it properly
df$factor <- factor(df$factor, levels(df$factor)[c(5,4,3,2,1)])

Subtle difference... but rather important!
